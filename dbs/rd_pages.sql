Further the ACL stabilises the knee during rotational movements like twisting, turning and sidestepping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ACL helps in controlling the rotational forces developed during landing from a jump. Also, it sends feedback to the brain providing information regarding the position of the knee and its balance.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/Anterior Crucial Ligament tear  (ACL)_html_602f2b7c1.jpg\" />\r\n<div class=\"btn-u btn-u-blue one-page-btn tc w100\" style=\"font-size:1.2rem;\">ACL tears are common during recreational sports</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<h4><strong>Causes of ACL Tear:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 tj\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/imageedit_25_7109887782.jpg\" />\r\n<div class=\"btn-u btn-u-blue one-page-btn tc w100\" style=\"font-size:1.2rem;\">ACL tear occurs when there is a strain to the knee joint</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/imageedit_27_4172341786.jpg\" />\r\n<div class=\"btn-u btn-u-blue one-page-btn tc w100\" style=\"font-size:1.2rem;\">A&quot;contact type&quot; injury causing ACL tear during sports activity</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n<p>ACL can be injured if the knee is bent backward, twisted, or bent side to side. During sports the injury can happen when the foot is firmly planted on the ground and a sudden force hits the knee <b>(contact type)</b> or this can happen when the player is changing direction rapidly, slowing down when running, or landing from a jump <b>(non contact type)</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent evidence shows that most of these injuries are non-contact and do not involve a collision with another player. This type of injury is common in soccer, skiing, football, and other sports with lots of stop-and-go movements, jumping, or weaving. Falling off a ladder or missing a step on a staircase are other likely causes for ACL tear.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n<h4><strong>Symptoms of ACL Tear?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A tearing or popping sensation is frequently reported at the time of ACL tear and immediate swelling is common due to bleeding from the ruptured ligament.When ACL is torn, the information regarding joint position and balance it carries is also lost and the knee may feel as if it is <b>unstable</b> or <b>giving way</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normal walking becomes difficult and sometimes painful. Sometimes the knee can get locked and so it becomes difficult to bend or straighten the knee freely. Because of the instability, there is a risk of injury to other structures of the knee joint such as the meniscus or the cartilage.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-7 tj\">\r\n<h4><strong>Why does the ACL fail to heal?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike other ligaments about the joint, the ACL passes through the joint and is surrounded by joint fluid.

It also helps in proper balancing of ligaments around the knee joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henceforth we can safely say that with the advent of <a href=\"computer-assisted-knee-replacement\">computer-assisted surgeries</a>, the technical issues have been ironed out and fewer <a href=\"revision-knee-replacement\">Revision Knee Replacement surgeries</a> are performed to rectify the failure of earlier surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth cause which in fact is yet another important reason for early joint failure is infection, which can happen either within few weeks after surgery (early infection) or can happen even months or years after surgery (late infection).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Is Infection common after knee replacement, what are its symptoms?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Infection can lead to failure of knee replacement, requiring revision surgery but this is a rare complication occurring in less than 1% of the patients. An infected artificial knee joint might become swollen, painful and inflamed, discharging fluid or pus. Sometimes the patient may complain of persistent pain and the joint may look otherwise normal. In such cases various lab tests and scans are done to confirm the diagnosis. In long standing infection the implant might start losing its attachment to the bone leading to serious dysfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>How can we prevent infection?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We can prevent infection by utilizing the following measures:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-unstyled\">\r\n	<li>1) A well-equipped operation theatre which has laminar flow with HEPA air filter</li>\r\n	<li>2) Use of Space suit to avoid the spread of infection</li>\r\n	<li>3) Use of disposable items, wherever possible</li>\r\n	<li>4) Use of antibiotics, as per the norms.</li>\r\n	<li>5) Proper control of diabetes in diabetic patients, before surgery.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/Page-2-Image-111.jpg\" />\r\n<div class=\"btn-u btn-u-blue one-page-btn tc w100\" style=\"font-size:1.2rem;\">Laminar airflow with HEPA Filters for Ultra clean Environment</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/Page-2-Image-2111.jpg\" />\r\n<div class=\"btn-u btn-u-blue one-page-btn tc w100\" style=\"font-size:1.2rem;\">Use of space suit to avoid infection</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n<h4><strong>What is the treatment for infected artificial knee?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We, at Dr. Raj Kanna&rsquo;s clinic, perform a two-stage procedure for the infected knee, which is a normal procedure followed by most surgeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first stage, we remove the infected knee and fill it with antibiotic cement spacer.

We generally get cardiologist opinion for all patients who are aged greater than 40 years prior to undergoing surgery. It is advisable to discuss with the cardiologist before stopping such medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>The evening before surgery</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The evening before surgery patient will be seen by the anesthetist. Type of anesthesia (Reginal or general) and other anesthesia-related queries can be sorted out with the anesthetist at this point. The patient will also be seen by a physician to manage comorbid conditions such as Blood pressure, Diabetes, etc&hellip; The ward nursing staff will prepare the leg planned for surgery. Also, they will do some sensitivity tests for medications which are to be given during and after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Type of anesthesia</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We as a routine prefer to give spinal + epidural anaesthesia to anesthetise the leg. Patient will be completely conscious during the procedure. But if the patient does not want to be awake a gentle sedation will be given, putting the patient to sleep till the end of the procedure. On few occasions we have to choose general anaesthesia where the patient becomes unconscious throughout the procedure. The choice of anaesthesia will be decided by the anaesthetist after having a complete discussion with the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Duration of the surgery</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally for a single knee replacement the time taken will be 70 to 90 minutes depending on the complexity of the case. We do all our cases with computer assistance which helps the surgeon to do every step of the surgery accurately without error.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>After the surgery</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>After the surgical procedure patient is observed in the recovery room for two to three hours and then they are shifted to their rooms. Aged patients (more than 75 years) or those with medical risks are observed in intensive care unit. Such patients are usually observed for 24 hours and then they are shifted to their rooms.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n<h4><strong>Pain Management</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We follow a specialized protocol which was co-published by Dr Rajkanna in an American journal, &ldquo;Journal of Arthroplasty&rdquo; in the year 2010.

Secondly the medications are carefully and rationally combines for maximum action with minimum or no side effects. Finally using cryo (ice) therapy and pain controlling pumps have revolutionized the pain management after such major surgeries.</p>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/2(1)1818-07-13 16_07_43.jpg\" />\r\n<p>The patient will be allowed to take fluid orally in about 5 to 6 hours after surgery.

The mild (Grade 1) level and moderate (Grade 2) level PCL tears usually heals well on its own and doesn&rsquo;t need a surgery. But the severe (Grade 3) level PCL tears and multiple ligament injuries require surgical treatment. A severe PCL injury, if not treated by surgery, can lead to an early onset of arthritis of the knee joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surgery is performed on complete tears of ligaments and takes place after a few weeks, to allow for the swelling to subside and allow for motion of the knee. The procedure is called Ligament Reconstruction replacing the torn PCL with a new ligament, which is usually a graft taken from the hamstring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are multiple techniques for PCL reconstruction, we do arthroscopic PCL reconstruction without opening the knee joint, which is the most advanced and effective method for treating complete PCL tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>What are the choices for Graft selection in PCL Reconstruction?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The different types of grafts used in PCL reconstruction includes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a)Autograft &ndash; Tissues taken from patient is used as graft.

It connects the inside aspect of the kneecap (Patella) to the thigh bone (Femur). MPFL prevents the lateral (outward) displacement of the kneecap (Patella) and helps keep it in position during the bending and straightening of the knee.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt-3\">\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-7\">\r\n<h4><strong>MPFL Tear</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>MPFL is torn when there is an injury to the knee, causing instability to the kneecap. The patella can also be dislocated from an accident or from a trauma to the knee during any sport related activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the MPFL is injured or torn, the patella is free from any restraint and it jumps out of the groove in the thigh bone. The injury can be treated quickly without surgery by applying plaster, right after the accident. However, repeated injuries and instances of instability might need the help of surgical interventions to heal.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col-sm-5\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/7 Surgery for Patella (Knee Cap)  instability_html_7fec01f9.jpg\" />\r\n<div class=\"btn-u btn-u-blue one-page-btn tc w100\" style=\"font-size:1.2rem;\">Medial patello-Femoral ligament (MPLF)</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If left untreated, MPFL will heal in a looser and lengthened position that makes it vulnerable for dislocations and damage the knee&rsquo;s cartilage. The MPFL tear is characterized by pain, swelling and disability due to dislocation.

The surgeon normally takes around an hour to perform the surgery and the patient can return home the next day with their knee in a brace. The patients can return back to their normal activities within 3 to 6 weeks after the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The procedure includes arthroscopy, a minimally invasive surgery. The torn tissue in the joint is cleaned up then a lateral release is performed where the ligament on the outside of the kneecap joint is loosened.

If you tear the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in your knee, you might need a reconstructive surgery of your knee. The ACL is a tough band of tissue joining the thigh bone to the shin bone at the knee joint. It provides the knee the stability and runs diagonally inside the knee. It helps to control the back-and-forth movement of the leg.</p>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/download (2).jpg\" />\r\n<h4><strong>Causes of ACL Injuries</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>ACL Injury can occur due to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Landing incorrectly from a jump</li>\r\n	<li>Stopping suddenly</li>\r\n	<li>Changing direction suddenly</li>\r\n	<li>Having collision</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If this ACL is torn completely your knee may become very unstable and lose its full range of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Treatments for ACL Injuries</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Arthroscopy: an arthroscopy is a type of keyhole surgery. It employs a medical instrument called arthroscope, which is thin, bendable tube with bundles of fiber-optic cables inside it. Also, it has a light source and the camera attached to it. The surgeon makes a small incision on the front of the knee and inserts an arthroscope. This will illuminate the knee joint and will transmit the image of the knee to a television monitor. This makes the surgeon to see inside of your knee clearly. Also through the incision, other medical instrument can be inserted. The surgeon will use these instruments to remove the torn ligament and reconstruct the ACL.</p>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"w100 m-0\" src=\"images/pages/about/download (3).jpg\" />\r\n<p>The graft tissue will be placed in the same position as the old ACL and held in right place with screws or staples that will permanently remain in your knee. After the grafting has been secured, your surgeon will test using enough tension in it, to see that the knees work properly. They will also check that knees have full range of motion and the graft inside the knees is capable enough to keep your knee stable when it is bent or moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the satisfaction of the surgeon that everything is working as it should, they will close the incision and will apply a suitable dressing over it. After the finishing of the procedure, you will be removed from the operation theater and moved to the hospital ward to begin your recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Kanna&rsquo;s Knee &amp; Ortho Clinic is headed by Dr. Raj Kanna.
